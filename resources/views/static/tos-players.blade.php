            as may arise from providing Digital Services.</p>
        <p>4.2. You must have all licenses, permits,liability insurance (if applicable), registrations, certifications
            and other documentation that are required in the applicable jurisdiction for providing the Digital Services.

            approvals, authority, registrations and certifications.</p>
        <p>4.3. You must provide the Digital Services in a professional manner in accordance with the business ethics
            applicable to providing such services and endeavour to perform the Customer's request in the best interest
            of the Customer. Among else, you (i) must perform the Digital Services in a way that are least costly and
            time consuming for the Customer, unless the Customer explicitly requests otherwise; (ii) may not make any
            unauthorised actions on the Customer's account; (iii) must provide the Digital Service without sharing the

        <p>4.4. You retain the sole right to determine when you are providing the Digital Services. You shall accept,
            decline or ignore Digital Services requests made by Customers at your own choosing.</p>
        <p>4.5. Costs you incur while providing the Digital Services. You are obliged to provide and maintain all
            equipment and means that are necessary to perform the Digital Services at your own expense, including a
            computer, internet connection, smartphone, etc. You are also responsible for paying all costs you incur in
            the course of performing the Digital Services including, but not limited to, mobile data plan costs, duty
            fees, insurance, relevant corporate or payroll taxes etc.</p>
        <p>4.6. Service Charges. You are entitled to charge a Service Charge for each instance you have accepted a
            Customer on the Eloking Platform and completed the Digital Service as requested. The Service Charge is
            calculated based on a default base Service Charge, the requirements of the Digital Services and the video
            game selected. With In-app payment, you may negotiate the Service Charge by sending us a pertinent request
            that has been either signed digitally or by hand. Additionally, you shall always have the right to charge
            the Customer less than the Service Charge indicated by the Eloking Platform. However, charging the Player
            less than the Eloking Platform indicates, does not decrease the Eloking Fee.</p>
        <p>4.7. With In-app payment, if you find that there has been an error in the calculation of the Service Charge
            and wish to make corrections in the calculation of the Service Charge, you must submit a petition by sending

            Charge or reimburse you for an error made in the calculation of the Service Charge.</p>
        <p>4.8. Eloking may adjust the Service Charge for a particular order completed, if we detect a violation (such
            as completing the Digital Service with poor quality or overcharging the Customer for the Digital Services)
            or in case a technical error affecting the final Service Charge is identified. Eloking may also reduce or
            cancel the Digital Service in case we have reasonable cause to suspect a fraud or a complaint by the
            Customer indicates a violation by you. Eloking will only exercise its right to reduce or cancel the Service
            Charge in a reasonable and justified manner.</p>
        <p>4.9. Customer have the option to pay the Service Charge for the Digital Services via the In-app Payment,
            as described in section 6 of these Terms and Conditions. In case the Customer fails or refuses to pay,
            Eloking will send a notice of debt to the Customer on behalf of you. Such authorisation derives from the
            mandate of paying agent given to Eloking and does not entail that Eloking has an obligation to compensate
            the Service Charge not paid by the Customer. If Customer justifiably refuses to pay the Service Charge on
            the account that your information stated in the Eloking Platform is incorrect, then Eloking will not
            reimburse you for such expenses.</p>

            company's registration (if applicable), the company's legal address (if applicable), VAT number (if
            applicable), the date, the time, the service description, the Service Charge and Tip paid for the provision
            of the Digital Services. The receipt of each provision of Digital Services is available to you via the
            Player Account.</p>
        <p>4.12. Cancellation fee & wait time fee. Customer may cancel a request for Digital Services that a Player has
            accepted via the Eloking Platform. Player may be entitled to some or full amount of the Service Charge for
            cancelled Digital Services in the event that a Customer cancels accepted request for Digital Services after
            those were already started by the Player.</p>
        <p>4.13. Your tax obligations. You hereby acknowledges that you are obliged to fully comply with all tax

            acts. Additionally, it is your obligation to adhere to all applicable tax regulations that may apply in
            connection with the provision of Digital Services. You hereby agree to compensate Eloking all state fees,
            claims, payments, fines or other tax obligations that Eloking will incur in connection with the obligations
            arising from applicable tax regulations not having been met by you (including paying the income tax and
            social tax).</p>
        <p>4.14. The Player's authorisation to issue invoices. Eloking has a right to issue an invoice on your behalf
            to the Customer in order to compensate you any Service Charges, contractual penalties or other fees that

        <h2>6. In-app Payments</h2>
        <p>6.1. We may enable Customers to pay for the Digital Service via cards, carrier billing and other payment
            methods directly in the Eloking Platform (i.e. In-app Payment). You hereby authorise us as your commercial
            agent to receive the Service Charges or other fees paid by the Customer via In-app Payment and to forward
            relevant funds to you. Any payment obligation made by the Customer via the In-app Payment shall be
            considered fulfilled as of the time that the payment has been made.</p>
        <p>6.2. You may not refuse payment by the Customer via the In-app Payment, or influence the Customer against the
            use of the In-app Payment. In case you refuse to accept an In-app Payment without just cause, we shall be

            Tip will be collected by Eloking on your behalf together with the Service Charges and other fees paid by the
            Customer via the In-app Payment. If the payment of the Tip is suspected as being fraudulent, illegal, for a
            purpose other than as a gratuity related to the service provided or used by a Player in conflict with our
            Terms and Conditions and, then the Tip can be withheld by Eloking.</p>

            that you are obliged to pay to us (i.e. Eloking Fees and contractual penalties). We reserve the right to
            fulfil any of your financial liabilities to Eloking, in which case we will acquire the right to submit a
            claim against you. We may set off any of your financial liabilities against financial liabilities that you

            Digital Services that you have provided. Your average rating will be linked to your Player's account and
            will be available to Customers at Eloking Platform. If we find out the rating or comment is not given in
            good faith, this rating or comment may not be projected in the calculations of your rating.</p>

            you do not increase your average rating or activity score to minimum level within the prescribed time
            period, your Player's account will be automatically suspended either temporarily or permanently. We may
            reverse the suspension of your account if it is merited by any external circumstances or it is detected that

        <p>9.1. Campaigns for Customers. We may occasionally arrange various campaigns to Customers in order to promote
            the Eloking Platform. If the Service Charge paid by the Customer is reduced by more than 40% as part of such
