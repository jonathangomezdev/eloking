            way for the fulfilment of the contract entered into between the Customer (you) and the Player. Disputes

            responsible for any such fees and disclaims all liability in this regard. Your payment method may also be

        <h2>4. Ordering and cancelling Digital Services</h2>
        <p>4.1. If you order a Digital Service and the Player has agreed to undertake the work then the Digital Service
            is considered to be ordered.</p>
        <p>4.2. Once a Player confirms that he/she will fulfil your order, you will enter into a separate agreement with
            the Player for the provision of the Digital Services on such terms and conditions as you agree with the
            Player. Eloking does not provide Digital Services and is not a party to your agreement with the relevant
            Player.</p>
        <p>4.3. Cancelling the use of an ordered Digital Service is considered to be the situation where the Player has
            replied to your request and you subsequently reject, cancel or refuse the Digital Service. When a Digital
            Service request is cancelled after certain time period you are required to pay a cancellation fee.</p>
        <p>4.4. If you cancel a Digital Service request on multiple successive instances within 24-hour we may
            temporarily block your account for warning. After multiple such warnings, we may suspend your account for
            longer period (e.g 6 months). After that period you could ask to reactivate your account and your
            application will be reviewed by Eloking.</p>
        <p>4.5. Sometimes Player may decide to cancel your request, please note that Eloking is not responsible for such
            situations.</p>
        <p>4.6. It is possible that the order price is changed upon discovering additional information that might increase the complexity or time to complete the specific order.</p>
        <p>4.7. Order details can be adjusted throughout the order fulfillment process if the order complexity or time to complete increases because of factors beyond control of the Player (such as Customer playing and losing ranks). Customer is aware and agrees that because of such situations orders can be marked completed without actually reaching the desired order outcome (i.e., rank not reached because customer lost rank while the order was still in progress).</p>
        <p>4.8. Customer acknowledges and accepts that if after purchasing an order there is no activity from Customer for more than 14 calendar days, the order will be marked as completed and no longer refundable.</p>
        <h2>5. Liability</h2>
        <p>5.1. As the Eloking app is an information society service (a means of communication) between Customers and
            Players, we cannot guarantee or take any responsibility for the quality or the absence of defects in the
            provision of Digital Services. As the usage of Eloking Platform for requesting Digital Services depends on
            the behaviour of the Players, Eloking does not guarantee that you will always have offers available for the
            provision of the Digital Services.</p>

        <p>5.3. The consumer’s right of refund is not applied to Eloking Platform orders. Requesting a refund from the

            guarantee that the app or website will function at all times, for example a public emergency may result in
            a service interruption.</p>
        <p>5.5. Eloking, its representatives, directors and employees are not liable for any loss or damage that you may

            euros. You will have the right to claim for damages only if Eloking has deliberately violated the contract.
            Eloking will not be liable for the actions or inactions of the Player and will not be liable for damages
            that the Player causes to the Customer.</p>
        <p>5.7. You agree to fully indemnify and hold Eloking, their affiliate companies, representatives, employees and
            directors harmless from any claims or losses (including liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of any
            nature) that they suffer as a result of your use of the Eloking Platform.</p>
        <p>5.8. Eloking may immediately end your use of the Eloking Platform if you breach these Terms and Conditions
            or we consider it necessary to protect the integrity of Eloking or the safety of Players.</p>
        <p>5.9. Customer agrees that Eloking takes no responsibility in cases where there are actions taken against Customer account (Steam, Riot, etc).</p>
        <h2>6. Good practice using Eloking Platform</h2>
        <p>6.1. We ask to fill out a feedback form in the Eloking Platform. This enables us to offer suggestions to the
            Players for improving the quality of their service.</p>
        <p>6.2. We expect that you use Eloking Platform in good faith and be respectful of the Players who offer their
            services through Eloking Platform. Eloking retains the right to close your account if you have violated the
            terms set out in this Terms and Conditions or if your activities are malicious, i.e. withholding payment
            for the provision of the Digital Service, fraud, being disrespectful towards the Players, etc. In these
            cases, your Eloking Platform account may be revoked without prior notice.</p>
        <p>6.3. Eloking will make every effort to ensure that only Players, who have integrity and are respectful of
            their profession and Customers, use the Eloking Platform. However, we are in no position to guarantee that
            every provider of Digital Services, located by the Eloking Platform, satisfies the aforementioned criteria
            at all times. If you experience objectionable Digital Service, please notify our customer support.</p>
