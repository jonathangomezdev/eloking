            <h2>Letter from a former <span>CS:GO</span> booster, now a board member at Eloking</h2>
            <p>I am an ex-CS:GO and Valorant booster with more than 300 completed boosting jobs. While working as a
                booster, I saw that there is a major issue on how customers and boosters are treated. Since my
                experience as a booster was so bad with many boosting sites, I wanted to change how essentially my
                booster friends and I was treated.</p>
            <p>When trying out various boosting platforms, there were many underlying issues in the business management,
                how boosters and customers are treated in general. Each platform had its own set of problems and almost
                none of them cared to even think about resolving them. There were only like 2-3 boosting platforms that
                actually care about boosters and customers but even with identifying the issues, the management was
                inexperienced and greedy, therefore providing just acceptable enough services for high costs. I was not
                okay with that.</p>
            <p>A few months later, I found a team of people who actively create successful startups and are experienced
                in business and focus on long-term growth and providing top notch quality. The three of us agreed on
                taking CS:GO boosting service to another level by providing the best boosters experience in the market
                (above the market earnings share, timely payouts, etc) as well as treating customers as they are
                already treated in other industries - godly.</p>
            <p>And this is how Eloking was born. By boosters, for boosters and customers that want to be treated
                professionally and have fun while being boosted or coached. With our careful vetting process for
                boosters and my partners' extensive experience with consumers, we are here to leave the competition
                miles behind. Try out our CS:GO boosters and I am sure you will never look for another boosting
                provider.</p>
