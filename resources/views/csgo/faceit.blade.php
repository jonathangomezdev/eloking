                <h2>About Eloking <span>Faceit</span> Boost</h2>
                <p>The main advantage we offer for Faceit boosting service is the exceptional skill level of our players. By having a proper business setup where everything happens legally and the players themselves are rewarded for their exceptional service, we have accumulated the best Faceit boosters in the market. Friendly attitude, discreet approach and occasional tips to improve are just a few of the many benefits you get when choosing Eloking for Faceit Boost.</p>
                <p>It is no secret that it is against Faceit rules to boost accounts. Sometimes, boosters can get banned for these services from Faceit and sometimes also elo rollbacks can happen. That is why we offer Elo insurance. Meaning, if any of your matches get canceled and your elo is decreased, we will help you get it back free of charge. Even taking that into consideration, elo rollbacks are incredibly rare. We have seen that happening only a handful of times during our boosting experience for many years. And boosters typically get bans only when they do that blatantly and share that with other people in chat. Since our boosters are careful, they haven't received any bans in Faceit while doing this daily since 2019. None of our customers ever received a Faceit ban for boosting service.</p>
