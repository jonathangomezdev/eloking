            <h2>1. General</h2>
            <p>1.1. You must be kind, helpful, and communicative with customers.</p>
            <p>1.2. If you pick up an order then you will have to start within 24 hours. If you start after a few hours
                you  have to inform the customer. For priority orders, you have to start playing within 10 minutes from
                picking up the order.</p>
            <p>1.3. You must not write or answer anyone while playing on the customerâ€™s account.</p>
            <p>1.4. Always notify the customer about your actions with their order. If you stop playing for more than an
                hour, tell the customer in the chat when can you continue.</p>
            <p>1.5. Do not contact or share your private contact details with our customer. We have zero tolerance for
                boosters offering services to our customers and accepting payments outside the site. This is called private
                boosting and will lead to a permanent ban on the first offense.</p>
            <p>1.6. Do not ask customers to leave tips. The system automatically asks customers to do that. Asking for
                tips may get you fined for a maximum of 10 EUR per case.</p>
            <p>1.7. Reselling orders is strictly forbidden.</p>
            <p>1.8. You must not pick up orders if you will not be able to give full attention to the newly picked up
                order. This includes being tired today and similar situations. You must pick up orders only when you
                are able to fully focus on fulfilling them as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p>1.9. In case you breached the rules, contact Eloking administration to potentially resolve the issue
                without receiving any fines or ban from the platform.</p>
            <p>1.10. You must show up at the time you scheduled with the customer. You may be fined if you agree on
                certain timeframes and fail to deliver on them.</p>
            <h2>2. Gameplay</h2>
            <p>2.1. If you're doing net wins and you lose games then you've to compensate the losses to wins. Let's say
                you have to do 3 net wins and you lose 1 game, then by the end of the boost you'll need to do total of
                4 wins (3-1+2 = 4) - 2 wins for each loss.</p>
            <p>2.2. You should never mention boosting or anything related to it while being in-game under any
                circumstances.</p>
            <p>2.3. If you don't finish orders within the approximate completion time of the services page or you
                underperform, you can get fined for a maximum of 70% of the order value.</p>
            <p>2.4. Getting any account in cooldown because of friendly fires or toxicity may get you fined for a
                maximum of 100% of the order value.</p>
            <p>2.5. For stream orders you must stream on either Youtube or Twitch privately.</p>
            <p>2.6. Delete all the videos after completing a stream order.</p>
            <p>2.7. You must allocate at least 4 hours per day for each open order (6 hours for priority orders) unless
                otherwise agreed with the customer.</p>
            <p>2.8. Never spend VP/RP/BE/Steam wallet or other platform currency unless the customer asked you to.</p>
            <p>2.9. If you change binds, crosshair and other settings in customers' account, make sure to revert the
                settings back to their original state as they were before you changed them after completing the boost.</p>
            <h2>3. Communication</h2>
            <p>3.1. All communication (chat, in-game and other) must be professional and friendly at all times.</p>
            <p>3.2. Get in touch with the customer immediately after picking up an order. You are expected to introduce
                yourself and guide the customer throughout the order.</p>
            <p>3.3. Keep the customer always updated. Let them know when you will start playing, how far you are with
                the order, when you stop playing for the day etc.</p>
            <p>3.4. Keep the admins updated by leaving order comments (they are not visible to the customers). If you
                stop playing for the day - leave an update in the order as an order comment (i.e., got 4 wins, 3 more
                to go).</p>
            <p>3.5. You are expected to write in proper English language. If you have poor English skills, please set
                up <a class="link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en" target="_blank" >Grammarly</a>
                (it is free) on your browser and use it while chatting.</p>
            <p>3.6. You are expected to reply quickly so please try to be online in the platform whenever possible.</p>
            <p>3.7. In the event you lost a game during a duo order, try to improve the customer experience by saying
                positive things such as "no worries, we will win next game". Under no circumstances you are allowed to
                become toxic, blame the customer and express similar behavior.</p>
            <p>3.8. All communication must happen through the Eloking portal. In case the customer told you something
                in-game or during a call, you are expected to leave an order comment informing Eloking admins about it
                (i.e., when will you play next games).</p>
            <p>3.9. In case the customer is rude, toxic or otherwise is difficult, please contact Eloking
                administration to resolve the issue.</p>
            <p>3.10. If you are not sure about how to answer the customer or what to do in a tricky situation, please
                contact Eloking administration.</p>
            <p>3.11. Before closing the order, thank the customer for the order and then proceed with closing the
                order.</p>
            <p>3.12. When closing the order, make sure to upload the relevant screenshot as a proof the order was
                completed successfully. In case the screenshot doesn't clearly show the order being carried out
                successfully, you are not entitled to any earnings for that order.</p>
            <p>3.13. It is forbidden to encourage customers to go chat privately, use another platform for boosting,
                etc.</p>
            <p>3.14. It is not allowed to complain about the platform or Eloking in general when speaking with the
                customer.</p>
            <p>3.15. It is not allowed to discuss any other orders with the customer. Even mentioning that you have
                other orders to work on is not allowed. Instead, you should fully focus on the current order for the
                customer.</p>
            <p>3.16. Do not over-promise and under-deliver. If you tell the customer you will reach a certain rank or
                play a certain amount of games in a certain timeframe and you do not achieve that, you may be fined.</p>
            <p>3.17. In case you are dropping an order, you need to communicate the fact with the customer so they are
                aware that another booster will take over.</p>
            <h2>4. Fines</h2>
            <p>4.1. Fines are to be decided by admins based on the limitations mentioned above.</p>
            <p>4.2. For cases not described above and in the Terms and Conditions, admins may decide reasonable fines
                for breaching the rules. The fines may be as harsh as terminating the boosters account permanently,
                fining for 100% of the lifetime revenue earned through this site and even initiating legal action.</p>
